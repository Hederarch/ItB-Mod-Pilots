# Hedera's Pilot Testfire
Thanks for testing my mods!

Feedback is preferred on the relevant channels of the official discord (or the specialized thread if that's still available): https://discord.gg/xRxPAb87JW

Check the Issues tab for known bugs that are being worked on.

Not a valid modpack yet, the folders need to be individually inserted into the game's mods folder.

*(also these do require the Into the Breach modloader. That shouldn't be a problem for most people but download it if you don't have it.)*

## What's Included
This pack consists of 2 new pilots, with more on the way soon.

**Apollo** - (Requires 1 Power) Shields all Mechs after finishing a mission with no Grid damage.

> An Old-Earth chess computer found in Archive's vaults, combined with a basic social AI to allow it to pilot Mechs. Its strategic skills transfer surprisingly well to Mech combat, but its newfound sentience has given it an insane superiority complex. It claims to be able to predict events hours in advance and drafts intricate plans of the exact steps that will lead to victory. Its visions of the future are likely delusions, but its plans do optimize grid usage, allowing enough surplus energy to power shields for the squad.

**Roy Rubold** - Summons 3 Tentacles at the beginning of each mission that attack Vek and Mechs alike.

> An Archive radio operator who managed to intercept Vek communications and contact the monstrosity living beneath the volcanic hive. He believes it's fallen in love with him, and manages to draw its attention to the surface, for better or worse. His research into Vek social behavior has given him an unfortunate fondness toward them and he proves reluctant to harm them, even for the greater good.

## What to look for
BALANCE - Are pilot abilites too strong? Too weak? Do they create unwinnable boards or dramatically change gameplay?

DIALOGUE - Are personalities charming? Are there typos? Are phrasings awkward or unclear?

SPRITES - Do they fit the game's art style? Do they display correctly?


I'll be updating these frequently, and I appreciate all feedback.
- Hedera
