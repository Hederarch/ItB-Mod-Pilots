# Hedera's Pilot Testfire
Thanks for testing my mods!

Not a valid modpack yet, the folders need to be individually inserted into the game's mods folder.

Feedback is preferred on the relevant channels of the official discord (or the specialized thread if that's still available): https://discord.gg/xRxPAb87JW

Check the Issues tab for known bugs that are being worked on.

Looking for my mechs? You can find them here: https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Squads

*(also these do require the Into the Breach modloader. That shouldn't be a problem for most people but download it if you don't have it.)*

## What's Included
This pack consists of 4 new pilots, with more on the way soon.

![Apollo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/699323570211520556/1021146960268365974/apollo.png)
**Apollo** - The Plan: (Requires 1 Power) Shields all Mechs after finishing a mission with no Grid damage.

> An Old-Earth chess computer found in Archive's vaults, combined with a basic social AI to allow it to pilot Mechs. Its strategic skills transfer surprisingly well to Mech combat, but its newfound sentience has given it an insane superiority complex. It claims to be able to predict events hours in advance and drafts intricate plans of the exact steps that will lead to victory. Its visions of the future are likely delusions, but its plans do optimize grid usage, allowing enough surplus energy to power shields for the squad.

**Roy Rubold** - Paramour: Summons 3 Tentacles at the beginning of each mission that attack both Vek and Mechs.

> An Archive radio operator who managed to intercept Vek communications and contact the monstrosity living beneath the volcanic hive. He believes it's fallen in love with him, and manages to draw its attention to the surface, for better or worse. His research into Vek social behavior has given him an unfortunate fondness toward them and he proves reluctant to harm them, even for the greater good.

![Fourier](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1006298746658771034/1021290808038674443/fourier.png)
**Fourier** - Reverb: (Requires 1 Power) Damages all enemies and mountains on Reset Turn.

> A primitive AI from a long-lost timeline. Intended to observe the effects of repeated breaches on sentient machines, a software error caused Fourier to forget her previous timelines and forever continue her research. After ruining her chronometer from overuse, her breaches grew less and less stable until they began to destructively interfere with each other and damage large structures in the surrounding area. It's unknown how aware she is of her surroundings, and she seems to think of combat as simply another experiment.

![Olga Ermanov](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1006298746658771034/1022006929423335434/olga.png)
**Olga Ermanov** - Entangled: After killing an enemy, teleport to its location.

> Olga was a Detritus recruit during the initial sweep for mech pilots, and was one of the greatest trainees to ever come out of the program. She became an experienced mech pilot, rumored to have saved a hundred timelines and exterminated millions of Vek. However during a routine breach out of the hive, the door to her time pod burst open, smearing her across space and intertwining her with the very Vek she fights. She still has some of her old talent, but she fights through a constant fog of warp sickness, severely dulling her legendary skill. 

## What to look for
BALANCE - Are pilot abilites too strong? Too weak? Do they create unwinnable boards or unexpected edge cases?

DIALOGUE - Are personalities charming? Are there typos? Are phrasings awkward or unclear?

SPRITES - Do they fit the game's art style? Do they display correctly?


I'll be updating these frequently, and I appreciate all feedback.
- Hedera
