This mod has a sequel! Check it out here: https://github.com/Hederarch/ItB-Mod-Pilots-2

*(also these do require the Into the Breach modloader. That shouldn't be a problem for most people but download it if you don't have it.)*

## What's Included
This pack consists of 6 new pilots, each with a unique twist to spice up your runs like never before.

**Apollo** - The Plan: (Requires 1 Power) Shields all Mechs after finishing a mission with no Grid damage.

> An Old-Earth chess computer found in Archive's vaults, combined with a basic social AI to allow it to pilot Mechs. Its strategic skills transfer surprisingly well to Mech combat, but its newfound sentience has given it an insane superiority complex. It claims to be able to predict events hours in advance and drafts intricate plans of the exact steps that will lead to victory. Its visions of the future are likely delusions, but its plans do optimize grid usage, allowing enough surplus energy to power shields for the squad.

**Roy Rubold** - Paramour: Summons 3 Tentacles at the beginning of each mission that attack both Vek and Mechs.

> An Archive radio operator who managed to intercept Vek communications and contact the monstrosity living beneath the volcanic hive. He believes it's fallen in love with him, and manages to draw its attention to the surface, for better or worse. His research into Vek social behavior has given him an unfortunate fondness toward them and he proves reluctant to harm them, even for the greater good.

**Fourier** - Reverb: (Requires 1 Power) Damages all enemies and mountains on Reset Turn.

> A primitive AI from a long-lost timeline. Intended to observe the effects of repeated breaches on sentient machines, a software error caused Fourier to forget her previous timelines and forever continue her research. After ruining her chronometer from overuse, her breaches grew less and less stable until they began to destructively interfere with each other and damage large structures in the surrounding area. It's unknown how aware she is of her surroundings, and she seems to think of combat as simply another experiment.

**Olga Ermanov** - Entangled: After killing an enemy, teleport to its location and swap tiles.


> Olga was a Detritus recruit during the initial sweep for mech pilots, and was one of the greatest trainees to ever come out of the program. She became an experienced mech pilot, rumored to have saved a hundred timelines and exterminated millions of Vek. However during a routine breach out of the hive, the door to her time pod burst open, smearing her across space and intertwining her with the very Vek she fights. She still has some of her old talent, but she fights through a constant fog of warp sickness, severely dulling her legendary skill.

**Sherrif Volke** - Escape Pods: Evacuates adjacent buildings at the start of each turn, but loses 1 move.

>Volke was an R.S.T. county mayor, hobbyist sharpshooter, and lover of the Old Earth wild west. During the initial sweep for mech pilots, he enlisted out of a sense of duty, or perhaps a chance to enact some good old frontier justice. He insisted his mech be equipped with additional time pod launchers to get civilians out of the combat, and used his position of power to strongarm his engineers into making it happen. However, the power needed to launch them to safety gets in the way of his Mech's movement.

**Helix** - Revenant: (Requires 1 Power) Fully heals on death and repairs other Mechs.

> One of Detritus' few ventures into artificial intelligence, Helix is a biological AI assembled from Vek biomass. It's surprisingly intelligent, but proves hard to discipline on the battlefield, and it seems to attack Vek out of a sense of insatiable hunger. The nanite cocktail allowing the Vek matter to interface with machines tends to leak out when damaged, melding nearby debris into the Mechs for temporary repairs.

Thanks for playing!
